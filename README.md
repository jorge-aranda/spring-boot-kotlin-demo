# Spring Boot + Kotlin Demo + Spock

#### Author: Jorge Aranda
This is a simple proove of concept using: Kotlin + Spring Boot. Nothing special
:-).

Also includes spock as test framework.

## Example with a /users and /logic controllers
This implementations are made with a memory-mapped persistence layer, kotlin
and Vavr for manage data and exception flows.

Also I tried to use vavr futures but nowadays has no good integration with 
Kotlin (Kotlin has own Future APIs)
